## Summary

A digital clock is something that many new developers try as one of their first applications for Javascript. I'm no different. While I had a basic understanding of Javascript, other than a simple website I hadn't really tried anything more advanced (at least for my abilities at the time). This was the first project I created that helped me learn about ternary operators. This was the perfect opportunity to put this new knowledge into practice.

I found that ternary operators not only made my code much easier to read, it removed a number of repetative lines in my code. This will definitely come handy in future, more complicated applications.
